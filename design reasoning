A lot of the decisions made for sylphnote have no reasons, and are fully open to re negotiation.
mako knows that not everything they've done has been in the interest of the user.

But, without further delay;

sylphnote's icons are cryptic!
	unless you're using the especially cryptic icon set, I disagree, either way, this shouldn't be a problem. The meaning of the icons will become clear with use, and is not of primary importance to using sylphnote.
	Still, I'm willing to reconsider this design directive if you're willing to argue your case. I conceed that would probably be a good idea to add text messages to go with the icons.

with an actionbar instead of a menubar, there's no true discoverability!
	True discoverability being mixed in with the regular functionality of the app is not a desirable feature. If the user wants to learn something new, they can ask for the features list[effortlessly]. If they wont do that, let them wallow in their ignorance.
