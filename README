dependencies:
	google's protoc and protocol buffer bindings.

	gtkmm >= 3.0

	a compiler supporting C++11

building:
	The makefile as it stands is only 6 lines long.
	The lines mentioning the compiler employed will probably have to be changed, go ahead and check it, you probably don't have g++-4.6 exactly.
