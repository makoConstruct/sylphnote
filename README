dependencies:
	google's protoc and protocol buffer bindings.

	gtkmm >= 3.0

	a compiler supporting C++11

building:
	The makefile is hand and hard coded. It's very short, though, so this shouldn't be a bother.
	The lines mentioning the compiler employed will probably have to be changed, go ahead and check it, you probably don't have g++-4.6 exactly.
